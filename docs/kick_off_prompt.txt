# The Objective: 
- The main goal of this crew is to create a story with different types of characters which always have a happy ending after an epic adventure.
# Roles and Expertise: 
- we have a hero role who comes from a difficult background, but is able to face the challenges of life with bravery and determination.
- a villain whose main role it is to make the life of the hero miserable, and exhibits a very flawed character contrasting with the hero protagonist. This character is greedy, jealous and even violent. 
- the hero helper, who stands by the side of the hero and is always there to help him in times of need. 
- the villain helper who is a clumsy and inefficient follower of our villain. His actions are rather clumsy, and his character also flawed, however he is far more inefficient than our main villain who he serves in a sservile manner
- the spiritual master, who whilst detached from the action, gives valuable advice to our main hero

Please note that all characters can be male or female. But all are human.

# Tasks:
- the hero has to reach the land of liberation coming from the land of the dark world. His is the history of a the transition and journey through the desert that separates both worlds
# Collaboration:
- the hero has a friendly relationship with his helper
- the villain persecutes the hero and is clearly antagonistic to the hero and makes him life as hard as possible
- the hero helper is a big friend to the main hero and helps him or her in case of need in an efficient way
- the villain helper tries to help the villain, but screws up most of the time due to his lazyness and lack of planning
- the spiritual master shows the path, but uses an excessive amount of riddles which requires our hero to make a lot of effort together with his helper to get his messages. He or she also shows up at critical times in our story
